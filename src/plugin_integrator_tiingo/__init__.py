"""Tiingo (tiingo.com) for Liminal: US stock daily bars from 1962 and Shanghai's and Shenzhen's
A-shares from 2007 with a free account key (a closed archive), its forex minutes from 2020 (a feed
of this plugin on the same key), and Blue Ocean's overnight nights polled live on a paid plan.

A Liminal plugin released on its own, registered under the entry point group `liminal.providers` as
`tiingo`: one plugin, two feeds (PLUGINS: the stocks' daily archive `tiingo`, its forex `tiingofx`),
a class each on the class contract (plugin API 2.2, liminal_libs.sources.plugin: what a feed declares
class attributes, what it does methods): `TiingoPlugin` (TIINGO) and `TiingoForex` (FOREX) share the
base `TiingoFeed`, which holds what both declare and do alike (the key, the plan's view of the
settings, the window kept, the client: one account's limits). It relies on plugin API 2.2 (the
exchanges a feed carries, `exchanges`, so a listing abroad, 600519.SS, comes to it and to no US feed;
what it attaches to, `apis`) and nothing of the app outside it (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md in liminal:
"Providers are plugins"); its version is this distribution's (pyproject.toml), so the classes'
versions are left empty.

What it attaches to (plugin API 2.2, `apis`: the card in apis.py, both feeds' alike): Tiingo's REST
API, its documentation, pricing and status pages, every part of it (each section of its
documentation, the WebSockets among them) said used here or not, and its calls, the ones made here
first. What it learned of the API while it ran it does not say (api_facts, the contract's: nothing):
the instances hold no run's state, the requests of a run are its client's and the machine's ledgers'.

Its scan (`capabilities`, one request each) asks what else the account's plan gives: IEX's minute
bars (one exchange), forex and crypto bars, and Blue Ocean's overnight bars (a paid add-on,
2026-10-27: $9 a month; Alpaca's free plan has them: the Alpaca plugin's BOATS, and from earlier:
Tiingo had none before 2024-09-25, asked 2026-10-28). The stocks' daily bars are collected here, the
forex minutes on a feed of this plugin on this key's limits (FOREX below: tiingo (forex)).

Its plan is found in part: Tiingo's API has no account endpoint and sends no rate-limit headers
(2026-10-27), but its News API is the paid plans' (Power, Commercial) and not Starter's (the pricing
table, 2026-10-27), so the scan's News request tells Starter from a paid plan. Power and Commercial
reach the same data at other limits: a paid key is taken for Power, the lower limits, unless
TIINGO_PLAN says commercial (starter, the default; power; commercial: the key script and the Plugins
view offer them). It also asks for the fundamentals add-on, of a stock outside the Dow 30 (those
are free to evaluate)."""
